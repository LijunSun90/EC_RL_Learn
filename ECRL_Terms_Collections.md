# Terms collection in the field of the evolutioanry computation versus reinforcement learning (ECRL)

## Terms:

* reinforcement learning (RL)

* evolutionary computation (EC)

* evolutioanry computation versus reinforcement learning (ECRL)

* multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)

* evolutionary multi-objective reinforcement learning (EMORL)

* evolutionary dynamic optimisation (EDO)

* deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL)

* multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL)

(several agents interact and learn in an environment simulatenously, either competively, cooperatively, or some mix of the two.)

* independent reinforcement learning (InRL)

(the simplest form of MARL, where each agentin oblivious to the ohter agents and simply treats all the interaction as part of its ("localized") environment.)

* Markov decision processes (MDPs)

* multi-objective or multi-criteria MDP (MOMDP)

* multi-criteria decision making (MCDM)

* neuroevolution

* dynamic programming

* adversarial environments

* Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)

* evolutionary Monte Carlo tree

* meta-heuristics

* hyper-heuristics

* coevolutionary computation (CEC)

* competitive CEC

* dynamic and adversarial envrionments
