* fitness sharing

(the number of individuals within a given niche is controlled by sharing their fitness immediately prior to selection, in an attempt to allocate individuals to niches in proportion to the the niche fitness. And the use of fitness proportionate selection is implicit within the fitness-sharing method.)

(allocates individuals to fitness peaks in proportion to their fitness)

* crowding

(distributes the population evenly amongst the fitness peaks)

(When a new offspring is inserted into the population, a number (CF) of members of the parent population are chosen at random, and then the offspring replaces the most similar of those parents.)
